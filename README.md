#The below is the problem statement which is given by catalog IT Solutions as a part placement drive.

Consider an unknown polynomial of degree m. You would require m+1 roots of the polynomial to solve for the coefficients, represented as k = m + 1.

An unknown polynomial of degree m can be represented as:

f(x) = a_m x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + ... + a_1 x + c

Where:

- f(x) is the polynomial function
- m is the degree of the polynomial
- a_m, a_{m-1}, ..., a_1, c are coefficients (real numbers)
- a_m ≠ 0 (since it's the highest degree term, ensuring the polynomial is of degree m)

This representation shows that a polynomial of degree m is a sum of terms, where each term is a coefficient multiplied by a power of x. The highest power of x is m, and the powers decrease by 1 for each subsequent term until we reach the constant term c, which has no x.

The task is to find the constant term i.e, ‘c’ of the polynomial with the given roots. However, the points are not provided directly but in a specific format.

You need to read the input from the test cases provided in JSON format.

JSON Input Format
Each input file (e.g., testcase1.json, testcase2.json) must contain:

"keys": Specifies n (total points) and k (minimum points needed).
Each point represented by:
"base": Base of the value (e.g., binary, octal, etc.).
"value": The value at the point, given in the specified base.

Code Explanation
convertToDecimal(value, base): Converts a given value from its specified base to decimal.
lagrangeInterpolation(points): Uses Lagrange Interpolation to calculate the constant term of the polynomial.
parseInput(data): Parses the input JSON data and converts points to decimal form.
findConstantTerm(data): Validates input points and calculates the constant term using Lagrange Interpolation.
calculateFromFile(filename): Reads a JSON file, calculates the constant term, and prints the result.
